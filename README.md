jquery-edit-with-table
======================
This plugin takes as input a hidden field who's value is 
space separated value. It will create a table with one row 
per value and the possibility to add/remove value. The hidden
field will stay synchronized.

Ie: <input type="hidden" value="first second third"/>
will create a table with 3 rows and button to delete the row,
plus a last row with a add button.
